# mint-chocolate-chip

A very simple one-time mint, any-time burn script.

That is, you can mint anything you want, one time.
Each instance produces a different policy ID.
You can mint anything you want during that one time mint, such as a CIP-68 reference token.
And then, you can never mint again, guaranteed.

But, anyone can burn at any time, if they wish to.
